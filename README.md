Grimified AI Stack
A portable, self-contained AI stack built around Ollama and the Gramified GUI.
Includes a ready-to-run Podman container and launch scripts for fast deployment on any Linux system.
Designed for reliability, portability, and zero-hassle setup — plug in, start, and run local LLMs anywhere.

Note: This stack does not include pre-pulled models. The README provides instructions for downloading the recommended models so they match the GUI’s options.
